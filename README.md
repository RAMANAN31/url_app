##Malicious URL Detection Web App##


Overview
This web application detects malicious URLs and classifies them as either 'malicious' or 'safe' using a machine learning model. Built with Flask and a custom-trained ML model, this tool helps identify potentially harmful URLs, improving web security by preventing phishing attacks and other malicious activities.

Features
Real-time URL detection: Submit a URL and get instant results on whether it's malicious or safe.
Machine Learning Backend: The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model that classifies URLs based on known malicious patterns.
User-friendly Interface: A simple, intuitive web interface that allows easy submission and viewing of results.
Technologies Used
Flask: Python web framework to handle the appâ€™s frontend and backend.
Machine Learning: The app uses a classification model built with Python's machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or others.
HTML/CSS: For building the web interface.
Python: The core language for building both the machine learning model and the web app.
How it Works
The app receives the URL input from the user.
The URL is then passed through a machine learning model that uses a pre-trained dataset to detect malicious characteristics.
Based on the model's output, the app will classify the URL as either Malicious or Safe.
Results are displayed on the interface for the user to view.
